# EDF Scheduler FWD

This repository contains the implementation of earliest deadline first scheduler based on FreeRTOS using kiel uVision referencing from [this paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/168CTtdRg9bC8qCEDYZ4aFjsa5cwQ6Qws/view?usp=share_link) from Regensburg University of Applied Sciences by Enrico Carraro.

The files are the edited files only, but require the rest of any demo folder from the FreeRTOS demo files to work. In my case , I used the demo files for the `ARM7_LPC2129_Keil_RVDS`.
